## Part 1
Create a new Javascript promise. Generate a random number. If the number is greater than 0.5, the promise resolves and returns a positive message, if the value is less than 0.5 the promise rejects and returns a negative message. Use this promise with a then and catch chain.

## Part 2
Now, instead of generating a random number inside the promise, pass a variable into a promise somehow. Consider wrapping your promise in a function. This time, your promise should do the following: If the value passed in is greater than 10, the promise resolves and returns a positive message, if the value is less than 10 the promise rejects and returns a negative message.
